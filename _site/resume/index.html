                        <li> Green Hills is an embedded software company that has developed compilers, debuggers, and RTOSs for 30 years across multiple industries. Since Green Hills develops software at a low level, Green Hills also works closely with semiconductor companies and other middleware providers to deliver a complete software solution. </li> 

                        <li>My job was to manage partner/client-relationships and to help shape product development/roadmap decisions; pursuing Green Hills' market-share growth while creating win-win situations for customers and business partners. To do this, I developed and maintained new business relationships with Manager, Director, and VP – level clients from various Global 500 companies in Asia, US, and Europe. Some of these companies included Sony, Samsung, Hyundai, Nissan, Suzuki, Renesas, etc... I would also frequently travel on business trips to Japan & Korea to visit clients/partners, working closely with local/international business development and engineering teams. As a result, I developed many professional skills; such as client management skills, business communication, professionalism in a corporate setting, etc...</li>
                        
                        <li class="jobMemoryTitle">A memorable moment at Green Hills Software:</li>
                        <li class="jobMemory">It was a hot summer afternoon in Nagoya, Japan and we were having lunch with one of our largest customers, Denso. In typical Japanese-business fashion, 5 of us sat on one side of the long table while 5 of them sat on the other side. As we sat there, a beautiful Japanese lady dressed in a kimono shuffled in and out, being careful to bow every time she entered and exited the room. It must have taken her about 15 minutes to serve us all because she carried nearly 200 different dishes and plates for what was I think the most extravagant meal I have ever had. And then it struck me. I, being the 23-year-old recent college graduate that I was, was the only person at that lunch below the age of 40. It was at that moment and the months that followed where I had to mature very quickly, learning to take my work seriously and with professionalism. Looking back, I would say I learned a lot from that job; and especially that lunch.</li>

                        <li> Invoca is a cloud-based performance marketing company in the affiliate marketing industry. They are an industry-leading company that delivers a complete call-marketing solution, which includes features such as sophisticated call-tracking, flexible campaign-management, powerful analytics, and clear call-attribution. Invoca's platform is developed using Ruby on Rails and Agile/Scrum-based methodologies.</li> 

                        <li>As a QA Software Engineer, my job was to create and execute test plans; debugging issues over the full software stack (front-end, application logic, services, data persistence) as well as server-side configuration issues. During this process, emphasis was placed on creating behavior-driven test plans to simulate user-caused state, a valuable perspective that has helped me tremendously for when I design and write software. Furthermore, I worked closely with the development team to promote software quality while dealing with a large code base, complex server infrastructure, rapidly growing database, and upgrading from Rails2 to Rails3. </li> 

                        <li class="jobMemoryTitle">A memorable moment at Invoca:</li>
                        <li class="jobMemory">It was my last day at Invoca and I remember feeling very conflicted. I was both happy that I was leaving to pursue untold, wondrous adventures in Japan and sad at the reality that I was leaving a company that I truly enjoyed working for. During my tenure there, the fun-loving youthfulness of that silicon-valley like engineering team left me wanting to come to work every single day. Also somehow, amidst impromptu nerf gun wars and the productivity associated with working at the company bar in the basement, we still accomplished a great deal. And on that day I too felt that I had accomplished a lot on a personal level, effectively learning from and contributing to an already mature engineering team despite having been predominately self-taught in engineering. And though that day was sprinkled with drops of sadness, I felt an excitment to be headed off to Japan and continue doing what I love doing. Software and Japanese.</li>

                        <li>Lloyd House Studious is a software development group that a few of my friends and I started. We primarily do contract work using Ruby on Rails, but we also do fun side-projects from time to time.</li> 

                        <li>As a freelance software engineer, I work closely with the clients, helping them shape their ideas by including them throughout the iterative development process. After clearly defining the scope with the client, my team and I typically begin by road-mapping the project and discuss ways we can effectively coordinate our efforts. Throughout the planning and development process, we make a concerted effort to have open channels of communication, as good communication is a key to success. And despite working from different continents, I think we do a great job at that. As far as development goes, we tend to use Ruby on Rails for the framework, Git for version-control, RSpec for unit and functional tests, postgresql for the database back-end, and nginx/thin for the servers.</li> 

                        <li class="jobMemoryTitle">A memorable moment at Lloyd House Studios:</li>
                        <li class="jobMemory"> I think one of the greatest things about being a freelance developer is the ability to work from anywhere. I remember at one moment I was coding at a coffee shop located in the beautiful, amber-sky filled Arizona desert and then just a few days later at a lake in the picturesque ski-resort mountains of Nagano, Japan. The creativity generated from being in such an environment is truly inspiring and is something that has helped my coding substantially. And similarly, creativity is what I earnestly enjoy about software. Of course not without humbly standing on the shoulders of giants, but for me making software allows the imagination to run free and bring to life something out of nothing; blissful, pure creation. And that joy of creation is what I will always remember about my days as a freelance developer.</li>
