My Jekyll-based personal website

Make sure you have the required gems before generating the site. Just do a `gem install jekyll`. For more info check out http://jekyllrb.com/

After you've downloaded my website and have installed the gems, run `jekyll build` to generate the site. Then run `jekyll serve` to see it deployed locally. 

Feel free to also take a look at how the site looks live. http://harrisontouw.com
